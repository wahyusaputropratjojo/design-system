## Welcome

This design system is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and standards that allow us to build high-quality, consistent user interfaces. Our goal is to streamline the development process, foster collaboration between designers and developers, and create a cohesive user experience across all our products.

### What you'll find here

*   **Foundations**: The core principles of our design language, including colors, typography, and spacing.
*   **Components**: A library of reusable UI components, complete with documentation on how to use them.
*   **Guidelines**: Best practices and accessibility standards to ensure our products are usable by everyone.

Whether you're a developer, designer, or project manager, this documentation is your single source of truth for building beautiful and functional user experiences.
